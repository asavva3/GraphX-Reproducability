# GraphX - Reproducability Assignment for Distributed Data Processing Systems, Leiden University

This is the repository for the assignment of the Distributed Data Processing Systems about Reproducability.
We chose to reproduce 2 experiments from the paper: GraphX: Graph Processing in a
Distributed Dataflow Framework,Joseph E. Gonzalez;Reynold S. Xin;Ankur Dave, Daniel Crankshaw, and Michael J. Franklin, University of California, Berkeley;
Ion Stoica.
We chose to reproduce the experiments for the perfomance of GraphX against naive spark
and scalability.
